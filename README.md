# Moonbase Wordpress Theme

Ultra-minimal WordPress theme intended to be used as a base theme for client websites:

- Smartly organized starter CSS using Tailwind, with automatic bundling via `eslint`.
- Lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
- Custom layout templates in `partials/`.
- Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your theme neat and prevent duplication.
- Custom cleanup function in `inc/template-cleanup.php` to remove non-essential WP injections.
- Some small tweaks in `inc/template-functions.php` that can improve the theming experience.
- Uses `@dir-archiver` to bundle theme files as an easy to upload `zip` file.
